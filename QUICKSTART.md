## FAQ

**Q: Do I need Wallpaper Engine from Steam?**  
A: Only if you want to use animated wallpapers. Photo mode works without it.

**Q: Where are Wallpaper Engine wallpapers?**  
A: They're in your Steam Workshop folder: `~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/workshop/content/431960/`

**Q: Can I use both Photo and Wallpaper Engine modes?**  
A: Yes! Switch between them using the "Use this mode" button in each tab.

**Q: Performance impact?**  
A: Photo mode: negligible (~2% CPU). WE videos: 2-30% CPU depending on hardware decoding.

**Q: It doesn't work after installation?**  
A: Make sure you ran `setup_wallpaper_engine.sh` and restarted plasmashell.

**Q: Black screen when selecting wallpaper?**  
A: Check logs: `./tools/logs.sh` and make sure the setup script was run.

**Q: How to uninstall?**  
A: Delete `~/.local/share/plasma/wallpapers/wallpaper-engine/` and remove the systemd override: `rm -rf ~/.config/systemd/user/plasma-plasmashell.service.d/wallpaper-engine.conf`
